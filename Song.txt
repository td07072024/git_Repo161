Males sing to defend small territories (when living in colonies, less so in solitary pairs) and to attract mates. Males sing throughout the breeding season, from late April into August in many parts of the range. Their song is made up of a "twitter warble," followed by a rising "P-syllable" in European H. r. rustica and the North American H. r. erythrogaster.[56] In all subspecies, this is followed by a short "Q-syllable" and a trilled series of pulses, termed the "rattle."[57] The rattle is sometimes followed by a terminal "Î©-Note" in some subspecies' populations, and always at the end of H. r. tytleri song.[56]

Female songs are much shorter than male songs, and are only produced during the early part of the breeding season.[8] Females sing spontaneously, though infrequently, and will also countersing in response to each other.
